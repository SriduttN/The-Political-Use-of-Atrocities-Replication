In the takeover of Mazar-i-Sharif, Taleban troops also killed eight Iranian officials at the Iranian consulate and killed an Iranian journalist, creating tension between predominantly Sh'ite Moslem Iran and the Taleban, which is Sunni Moslem and follows a strict conservative sect. Human Rights Watch, which interviewed dozens of survivors who reached safety in neighbouring Pakistan, reported that after the Taleban swept into Mazar-i-Sharif on Aug. 8, its soldiers sought out and killed members of the Hazara ethnic group, who are Shi'ite Moslems. Members of the Tajik and Uzbek communities were also targeted as Taleban soldiers with their trademark black turbans and white flags shot people at random on the streets and bazaars of the northern city, the report said. The report quoted eyewitnesses as saying that women and girls, particularly in certain Hazari areas of the city, were raped and abducted.

Reports said gunfire was heard from inside the legislature after the blast and that two militants had managed to enter the building.""

The Sudanese embassy said that ""if there were bombings, they would only target rebel sites and positions no civilians live in Tine, only rebels.""  Since the article does not indicate that only rebels live in Tine, the noncombatant status of the victims is coded as ""contested"" even though the article contains no explicit assertion that the residents were noncombatants. The vicitm identity in this case is tough to code.  On one hand, they could have been random residents of the town, but on the other hand, they probably were politically targeted because of the circumstances surrounding the bombing.  Prior to the alleged bombings, the government warned the residents of the region to evacuate.  This indicates that the government prepared to bomb for a specific reason, namely to kill rebels.  Presumably there would be a political gain in doing so, and even if civilians did die in the meantime, there would have been political gain (e.g. the government is ""tough on rebels."")  Therefore, the vicitms are coded as both ""random/unclear/other"" and ""political.""  Also, for these reasons, I have chosen to code any noncombatant deaths as ""collateral damage.""  The intent is coded as ""intent apparent but not asserted"" over ""killing deliberate, but victims not intentionally targeted"" because it is obvious that the possibility of ""collateral"" deaths existed in this instance.

On November 20, a group of young men and village elders took a flotilla of speedboats across the Bomadi Creek from Ojobo to ""Rig 75"", a mobile platform operated for Shell by the US firm Parker Drilling, to protest at what they see as the oil companies' failure to honour a promise to invest in the community.  As the protesters boarded the rig troops arrived from a nearby oil facility, Shell's Benisede flow station, where they are based. Gunfire soon broke out. What happened next is unclear and bitterly disputed; while the army insists that no-one was killed and Shell says that an initial inquiry found no evidence of fatalities, clearly distraught relatives showed reporters seven fresh graves which they said were filled with the victims of the shooting. Army spokesman Colonel Yusuf Mohammed said: ""They are all telling lies. The elders were having a meeting with the oil company when the youths disrupted them. The soldiers came to disperse them and only some few of them were injured. The army did not kill anybody, it's all lies."" However, both the army and Shell confirmed that 12 young men were shot and wounded in the incident and flown by company helicopters to the oil city of Warri for treatment. The military said they were injured during a scuffle in which a demonstrator attempted to grab a soldier's weapon. In Ojobo's run-down general hospital, 28-year-old Stanley Pakemi was recovering from what doctors confirmed to be the wounds from a whipping. He told reporters that he had been arrested after the shooting and taken away to Benisede, where he was imprisoned for two days inside the Shell facility. ""The soldiers beat me four times daily. They used electric wires and horsewhips,"" he said. Shell said they had no information on his allegation.

Security forces moved into the streets and the ensuing violence caused 40,000 refugees to flee. Amnesty said the human rights violations caused by security forces and military-trained militia included extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, arbitrary arrests and torture.

The convoy was leaving the border village of Marwaheen, when it was attacked. An Associated Press photographer said he counted 12 bodies in two cars that were destroyed by the attack shortly after midday (0900GMT). Several hours earlier, Israeli forces across the border told villagers by loudspeaker to leave the area by 6 p.m. (1500GMT) or else the village would be destroyed. They did not give a reason for the ultimatum. The convoy of several vehicles was hit near the border fence about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the village. 
The residents said they had first gone to a U.N. peacekeepers position manned by Ghanian forces to take refuge but they were turned down. There was no immediate confirmation from U.N. peacekeepers, who have a force in southern Lebanon.

A doctor, Ali Zeineddine, said they were burned alive. ""It is very difficult to identify the bodies or to distinguish between girls or boys, as the 18 victims perished from the fire triggered by incendiary shells.

Photographs taken at the scene of the carnage show bodies of young children and adults torched to a cinder, some of the corpses unrecognizable with limbs burnt entirely off. They had been among residents fleeing villages close to the Israeli border and were killed when missiles struck a car and a minibus near Shamaa, hospital sources said. The children were aged between 7 and 12. ""We managed to extract four bodies which were completely burnt and evacuated to Tyre, but the others remained in the burning car for more than three hours because the Israeli shelling on the border road prevented us from carrying out our mission,"" said civil defense worker Abbas Moghrabiyeh... ""A logistics team has retrieved 13 bodies,"" an officer with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) told AFP. A rescue worker who transported the first bodies to Tyre said five more were left in the minibus. Ten other people were transported to hospital for treatment for burns and fractures, medics said. Four of them were hit in the minibus and the six others -- a couple and their four children -- in a small car. "" Another Agence France Presse report indicated that: ""The Israeli army said Saturday it regretted the deaths of 18 Lebanese civilians killed in an Israeli helicopter attack, but said Hezbollah militias were to blame for putting their lives in danger. The military said in a statement that Israeli forces had targeted an area near the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre, ""used as launching grounds for missiles fired by Hezbollah terror organisation at Israel."" ""The IDF (Israeli Defence Force) regrets civilian casualties while targeting the missile launching area,"" it said. ""Responsibility for endangering the civilian population rests on the organisation which operates and launches missiles at Israel from populated civilian areas,"" the army said.""

Second, the government had barred the monitors from the scene immediately after the bodies had been discovered. Third, confidential conversations with ''highly reliable sources'' had pointed to the culpability of the security forces. The 17 employees of the French branch of the international aid agency Action Against Hunger were found dead on Aug. 6 in the agency's office in Mutur.

Israel has said it would attack any vehicle on roads south of the Litani, assuming it was carrying Hezbollah weapons or fighters. The photographer said that when the convoy left the Israeli-occupied town of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, it was made up of more than 600 civilian vehicles in addition to vehicles carrying 350 Lebanese soldiers and police. A few vehicles had left the convoy before it was hit, the photographer said....Two armored U.N. peacekeeping vehicles were to have accompanied the convoy, Daher said, but were not present when Israeli forces in Marjayoun gave the convoy permission to head north.

""Acting on the suspicion that these were Hezbollah terrorists transporting weaponry an aerial attack was carried out,"" it added...

Four hospitals across Gaza were treating the wounded, whom Palestinian hospital officials said were all civilians.

The battle began after mortar rounds fell on Buhriz, a suburb of Baqouba, some 60 kilometers (35 miles) northeast of the Iraqi capital, a police officer said on condition of anonymity out of security concerns. 
Residents and local police amassed at the center of town and took up positions in grassy areas on the edge of Buhriz, battling suspected al-Qaida attackers for three hours, the officer said. Eight of those killed were gunmen, and six were civilians, he said. Twenty others were wounded -- all civilians, the officer added. Another officer, Col. Yahya al-Nidawi, said locals succeeded in fighting off the al-Qaida attackers. With the help of almighty God, the brave residents of Buhriz and our gallant police, we were able to repel and eliminate them (the attackers),"" al-Nidawi said. By midmorning, several bodies lay scattered on a main street in Buhriz, with residents milling around them. One of the dead men was wearing an ammunition vest, but it was unclear whether he was a resident or one of the attackers. Grieving relatives loaded at least two bodies into wooden coffins covered in blankets.""

Mende said that the report was riddled with inaccuracies and that local authorities quoted by ASADHO had denied supplying information to the group. 'This feeds our doubts as to the authors of the report actually travelled to Mbandaka,' he said. ASADHO said its sources included local civilian and military authorities, hospitals, religious communities, as well as Mbandaka residents.

Army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani's apology may have been partly aimed at winning the sympathies of Pashtun tribes, whose support is vital for U.S. ally Pakistan as it presses ahead with offensives against al Qaeda-backed Taliban militants. Residents and local government officials said 63 civilians were killed in the attack on suspected Taliban militants on the remote village of Saravilla on April 10. The military initially denied civilians died. Military officials later said the strikes killed 30 militants and then another assault killed up to 20 civilians who gathered afterwards at the site and were mistaken for Taliban fighters. Kayani apologised to the Kokikhel, a pro-government tribe, over the ""loss of precious and innocent civilian lives"".","","International","Reuters","Local","Pakistani military","","","17 April 2010 LBA0000020100417e64h0005s","","AI",2010-04-10

The three-month old conflict in Ivory Coast has entered a new level of intensity. With each passing day, the regime of Laurent Gbagbo is proving it is willing to go to any length to stay in office following an election that international observers say he lost. Sirah Drane, 41, who helped organize the march, said she was holding the megaphone and preparing to address the large crowd that had gathered at a traffic circle in Abobo. ""That's when we saw the tanks,"" she said. ""There were thousands of women. And we said to ourselves, 'They won't shoot at women.' ... I heard a boom. They started spraying us. ... I tried to run and fell down. The others trampled me. Opening fire on unarmed women? It's inconceivable."" The attack prompted an immediate rebuke from the U.S., which like most governments has urged Gbagbo to step down and has recognized his rival as the country's legitimate president. ""The moral bankruptcy of Laurent Gbagbo is evident as his security forces killed women protesters,"" said U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley in a Twitter message. Nearly 400 people have been killed in the west African country, including 32 in the last 24 hours, almost all of them men who had voted for opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, according to U.N. figures and combined with deaths confirmed by The Associated Press.""","","International","Agence France Presse, Reuters, Associated Press","Local","Witness Sources","","","AFP 03/03/2011:                           AFPR000020110303e733005qd Reuters 03/02/2011:                    LBA0000020110303e733000t8          AP 03/03/2011:                    APRS000020110303e733001jv","","ELH",2011-03-03

Ahmed Khalifa, a spokesman for the rebel movement in the eastern city of Benghazi, said the count was based on numbers obtained from hospitals in the city. He told a news conference that medicine was running low but two boatloads of supplies had reached the coastal city on Monday. He said one came from Italy, but did not give further details. Rebels and forces loyal to Gaddafi both have claimed control over parts of Misrata and fighting appeared to persist in the fiercely contested city, Libya's third largest. Khalifa said rebels had destroyed two tanks in the south of Misrata and captured several mercenaries and a Libyan army colonel during fighting, though he did not give precise dates. He also said Gaddafi had sent a busload of people in civilian clothes to the city who opened fire when they got out. It is impossible to verify reports about the fighting in Misrata because Libyan officials have prevented journalists from reporting independently from the city. Libyan government officials describe the rebels are ""armed gangs"" bent on destabilising Libya and terrorising ordinary people.","","International","Agence France Presse, Reuters","Local","Rebel and Witness Sources","","","AFP 03/21/2011:                       AFPR000020110321e73l0080y Reuters                                  03/22/2011:           LBA0000020110322e73m000im 03/29/2011:                 LBA0000020110329e73t000nk           ","","ELH",2011-03-20

A government official called the allegations baseless. Abdirahman Mahdi, the spokesman for the Ogaden National Liberation Front, accused Ethiopian security forces of attacking villages near oil exploration sites. The Ethiopian region known as Ogaden, which borders Somalia, has been mired in a low-level insurgency since the early 1990s, when the ONLF intensified its attacks against Ethiopian troops in a fight for greater autonomy. ""It is a random killing aimed at terrorizing the public,"" Mahdi said from his office in London. ""This is the first time security forces turned up in villages, rounded up villagers and killed them in brutal manners."" Relatives who spoke to The Associated Press said the recent killings occurred near Degahbur town. Mohamed Gure, the information minister for the regional Somali government, denied that such killings took place, calling the allegations ""baseless propaganda."" But a 21-year old in the region, Aden Ahmed Abdi Hassan, told AP by phone that his brother, Hure, was killed by policemen who smashed his head with a stone. The name Hure appeared on a list of 37 people the rebel group said had been killed between May 7 and Monday. The group says another 60 people are missing. The World Food Program said a staffer was killed in the same region last week. Hassan said that in addition to his brother, he saw the dead bodies of 11 others.""","","International","Reuters, Associated Press","Local","Rebel Sources","","","Reuters 05/16/2011:                    LBA0000020110516e75g001f0            AP 05/19/2011:                      APRS000020110519e75j001sh      ","","ELH",2011-05-07

On Tuesday, the paramilitary Frontier Corps and police gunned down five Chechens near a security checkpoint on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, saying explosives were strapped to their bodies and they were attempting to attack government forces.  But the media raised doubts over statements by security forces, with television footage showing a wounded woman waving her hand in the air before her death.  The daily Dawn on Thursday quoted witnesses as saying that the suspects were unarmed, had put up no resistance to the security forces and appeared to be about to surrender.  Two officials of a bomb disposal squad which searched the bodies after the shooting told Reuters that they found no explosives strapped to the bodies of the Chechens.  ""They were unarmed and had no suicide jackets or explosives with them,"" one of the officials said.  ""Five valid and two expired Russian passports were found in a ladies' handbag lying with the bodies,"" the second official said.  A witness earlier this week said the five had got out of a vehicle and were chased by police before they were shot.

State media variously have blamed terrorists, rioters or thugs for Monday's violence in the Xinjiang region. An exile group that advocates for greater Uighur autonomy instead has said a peaceful protest turned into a bloody clash between police and demonstrators. A group of ""religious extremists"" opposed to the Chinese government arrived two days earlier in Hotan and organized the terror attack in the city, a Xinjiang regional government spokeswoman told The Associated Press.  The men first stabbed a Uighur security guard at the gate of the police station before storming inside. They later took several hostages, including two female Han Chinese who were stabbed to death. A Han Chinese paramilitary officer was killed by a bomb the attackers set off, she said.  Four other hostages, all Uighur, were also injured, she said.  ""The attack was not about ethnicity,"" Hou said, ""They were charging into the police station to oppose the government and create violence.""  Hou said the men took down a Chinese flag at the station and raised a black flag with Arabic writing on it but she couldn't say what the writing meant. They were ""shouting slogans like 'Sacred War' and 'Allah,'"" she said.  A Germany-based Uighur exile group, the World Uyghur Congress, based its account of the violence on anonymous Uighur sources in Xinjiang. The group said in an emailed statement that the violence erupted when more than 100 Uighurs gathered to protest a police crackdown in the city.

Airstrikes in the Nuba Mountain areas of South Kordofan state also wounded 45 people, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in the statement. The rights groups said that Sudanese government restrictions have prevented aid groups from delivering food and other assistance to more than 150,000 people displaced by the violence in the contested region. ""Indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and restrictions on humanitarian aid could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser. South Kordofan lies just across the border from South Sudan, which gained independence from the north on July 9, and has been the site of clashes between government troops from Sudan's Arab north and black tribesmen aligned with the south's Sudan People's Liberation Movement. Many inhabitants of South Kordofan fought for the south during the country's two decades-plus civil war against the north and are ethnically linked to the south. ""The relentless bombing campaign is killing and maiming civilian men, women, and children, displacing tens of thousands, putting them in desperate need of aid, and preventing entire communities from planting crops and feeding their children,"" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Researchers from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch investigated 13 air strikes in the Kauda, Delami, and Kurchi areas of South Kordofan during a week in late August, the statement said. The groups said they witnessed government planes circling over civilian areas and dropping bombs, forcing civilians to seek shelter in mountains and caves. Sudan's government on Tuesday said the mountains are home to rebels armed by South Sudan and urged the U.N. to take action against the South Sudan for violating a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of conflict.""","","International","Agence France Presse, Reuters, Associated Press ","Local","NGO Sources","","","AFP 08/30/2011:                AFPR000020110830e78u00004  Reuters 08/30/2011:                       LBA0000020110830e78u000bz               AP 08/30/2011:               APRS000020110830e78u0013u        ","","ELH",2011-08-10

In an apparently mistaken strike, at least one warplane hit a mosque about one km away, shattering one of its walls and killing seven civilians, Mohammed said. Mohammed Hussein Nasser, a local government official, said dozens of people had been killed and wounded in the strikes on the town. He did not provide exact figures. A secondary school that was used as a field hospital by militants was also hit by airstrike, he said. The Yemeni air force also bombed the security headquarters but there were no immediate reports of casualties.""","","International","Reuters, New York Times, Associated Press","Local","Witness Sources","","","Reuters 09/05/2011:                       LBA0000020110905e795000s2         AP 09/05/2011:                APRS000020110905e795000zx    NYT 09/06/2011:                 NYTF000020110906e79600057 ","","ELH",2011-09-05

The United Nations human rights division said pro-Assad forces had killed 2,700 protesters since an uprising demanding his removal started in March, including at least 100 children. Human rights campaigners and Western diplomats in Syria also report increased assassinations of protest leaders, more deaths from torture and mass arrests that have seen tens of thousands of Syrians detained, focusing recently on professionals and academics critical of President Bashar al-Assad. The assault on Houla, a collection of villages north of Homs, 165 km (100 miles) north of Damascus, followed a large protest on Sunday demanding Assad's removal. About 12 government soldiers manning rural checkpoints had defected, activists said. ""Several of the defectors put up a fight but they were overwhelmed. The rest were civilians who were killed by the random gunfire from the tanks as they went through al-Houla,"" said a resident who gave his name as Abu Yazan. He said 14 people, including school-age students, were arrested in Taldo, Kfar Laha, Takltheb Tibeh and Iqreb villages. Local activists said troops launched a similar operation on Monday in the northwestern region of Jabal Shahshabo near Turkey and house-to-house raids in the town of Dumair north of the capital Damascus. In Homs, activists said security forces fired live ammunition overnight to disperse protests across the city in honor of 19-year old Zeinab al-Hasni who was arrested in July to exert pressure on her activist brother.

""In the name of my party I would like to express our shock and sadness,"" he said, while calling on the public to await the results of an investigation. If the victims are confirmed as civilians, it would be one of the deadliest such incidents in the long-running Kurdish separatist conflict in Turkey. Ankara's joint military command said its jets had bombed an area inside Iraq regularly used by PKK rebels after army drones had detected movement along the border.

Up to 30 people were killed execution-style out of the 180 murdered during violence that hit the state during the 12-day strike, said Arthur Gallas, head of the police department's homicide department, during a late Monday briefing for reporters.  The victims' bodies were found with their hands cuffed or tied behind their backs, he said. All of them had been shot in the head at close range with heavy caliber weapons such as the rifles Brazil's police carry.  Prevalent in many Brazilian cities, such militias are paramilitary criminal organizations made up of former or active-duty officers that dominate poor areas, extort residents and often double as extermination squads, according to legislative and judicial investigations.  Investigators said it appears the militias took advantage of the strike to execute people who had been causing trouble in the areas they control.

The blast hit the neighborhood of Bayada, the television reported, blaming ""armed terrorist gangs."" If confirmed, the attack would be the first of its kind in Homs. It came as Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin insisted any outside intervention to stop the violence would be akin to behaving ""like a bull in a china shop."" But France and Britain dismissed Moscow's efforts to end nearly 11 months of bloodshed in Syria and cast doubt on Assad's claim that he was ""fully committed"" to resolving the crisis. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said at least 62 people were killed across the country on Wednesday, including 50 in Homs. Among those killed in the beleaguered city were three entire families slain overnight by ""shabiha"" armed regime supporters, he said. The dead included at least three children aged five, seven and 15. The most intense shelling was in Baba Amr, where at least 23 buildings were completely destroyed, including a home hit by a rocket that killed a little girl, Abdel Rahman said.

In Aleppo, a bastion of government support, the dual explosions wounded about 235 people, state television said, 14 of them critically.

Paul Danahar, a BBC correspondent travelling with the UN convoy, reported seeing gutted buildings in Al-Kubeir and no sign of life or bodies. ""The stench of burnt flesh is still strong,"" he wrote on Twitter, and quoted activists as saying government forces had removed victims' bodies on Thursday while the observers were being hindered from reaching the village. ""In front of me there is a piece of brain, in the corner there is a mass on congealed blood,"" he wrote. ""In front of a burnt out building is carcass of a donkey inside the buildings are gutted. The UN have not found any people yet. ""Who ever did this may have acted with mindless violence but attempts to cover up the details of the atrocity are calculated & clear."" AP reported ""Syria's main opposition group in exile, the Syrian National Council, also said 78 people were killed in Mazraat al-Qubair when government-aligned militiamen converged on the village from neighboring pro-regime villages. Some of the dead were shot in the head, others were slain with knives, the SNC said. It said 35 of the dead were from the same family and more than half of them were women and children. ""Women and children were burned inside their homes in al-Qubair,"" said Mousab Alhamadee, an activist based in Hama. Syria denied the opposition claims as ""absolutely baseless."" The exact death toll and circumstances of the killings reported overnight in Mazraat al-Qubair were impossible to confirm. One YouTube video purported to show the bodies of babies, children and two women wrapped in blankets and lined with frozen bottles of water to slow decomposition. Another row of bodies lay elsewhere: a grandmother, a mother, and five siblings and two cousins, according to the video narrator. All the corpses were neatly wrapped in white sheets, more frozen water bottles tucked among them. One toddler's arm covered her face. Their names were scrawled on pieces of paper and tucked into their shrouds. In another video were four blackened objects that the narrator said were the remains of a mother and two children who were shelled in their home. The authenticity of the videos could not be independently verified. Attempts to reach more witnesses and residents of the area were difficult.
