Both the military and rights activists agree that thousands of angry civilians marched on the camp in the village of Belbari, angry about the woman's death there the night before. But while Bhupendra Poudel, the defense ministry spokesman, said the crowd tore down the camp's barbed wire, sought to snatch solders' guns and tried to storm the small base, Kunjan Aryal of the rights group INSEC-Nepal said the villagers were protesting peacefully. ""They were not trying to storm in,"" he said. ""They were simply protesting."" Poudel also said the woman -- a suspected Maoist -- had been shot when she tried to slip into the base. Aryal, though, said the villagers believed the woman had been raped and killed by the soldiers. Poudel said 11 villagers had been injured, while Aryal put the total at 29.Aryal also believed the crowd had been emboldened by the country's political turmoil, when weeks of protests of hundreds of thousands of people forced King Gyanendra to return power to elected officials a few days ago. ""Because of the recent political changes they appear to be bold enough to march up to the army camp and seek justice,"" said Aryal, adding an INSEC staff member was at the base at the time of the shooting."" A related Reuters report noted that ""The demonstration was not linked to weeks of pro-democracy protests"" and placed the number of protesters at the camp at approximately 100.
